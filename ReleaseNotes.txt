Release notes Karbowanec 1.7.6

In this release was added SSL support for RPC with new startup flags for the daemon karbowanecd:

    --rpc-bind-ssl-enable to enable SSL for RPC service
    --rpc-bind-ssl-port SSL port for RPC service (default port is 32448)
    --rpc-chain-file (default name "rpc_server.crt", this is the "fullchain.pem" file is you use letsencrypt)
    --rpc-key-file (default name "rpc_server.key", this is the "privkey.pem")
    --rpc-dh-file (default name "rpc_server.pem")

The simplewallet also got new flags

    for its wallet RPC server:
        --rpc-bind-ssl-enable enable SSL for RPC service
        --rpc-bind-ssl-port (default 15100)
        --rpc-chain-file (=rpc_server.crt) SSL chain file
        --rpc-key-file (=rpc_server.key) SSL key file
        --rpc-dh-file (=rpc_server.pem) SSL DH file
    for client:
        --daemon-cert custom certificate file for performing SSL verification
        --daemon-no-verify disable SSL verification procedure

The walletd also got these flags:

--rpc-ssl-enable
--bind-port-ssl arg (=16100)
--rpc-ssl-enable 
--rpc-chain-file arg (=rpc_server.crt)
--rpc-key-file arg (=rpc_server.key)
--rpc-dh-file arg (=rpc_server.pem)

for wallet server

--daemon-port-ssl arg (=32448)
--daemon-ssl-enable
--daemon-chain-file arg (=rpc_server.crt)
--daemon-key-file arg (=rpc_server.key)
--daemon-dh-file arg (=rpc_server.pem)

for its builtin node.

How to create DH file:

openssl dhparam -out /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/rpc_server.pem 2048

Added new JSON RPC method resolveopenalias which may be used e.g. in wallets.

Release notes Karbowanec 1.7.5

This release contains improvements in JSON RPC methods and therefore is especially recommended to public nodes whose API is exposed to the world. Namely:

- Fixed JSON serialization of float numbers
- An error is returned if some of the reserve proof's transactions couldn't be found
- Limit the number of requested blocks in some methods
- Improve error handling in some methods

Release notes Karbowanec 1.7.4

- The update of Base58 encoding of signatures of messages
- The implementation of sign/verify messages in greenwallet and walletd
- The alt. blocks RPC method getaltblockslist, which, obviously, returns a list of alt. blocks short info (only those stored by given node)
- Checkpoints source files were moved to a separate folder

Release notes Karbowanec 1.7.3

- Change storage for various blockchain indexes
- Exposed these RESTful-like API endpoints for GET requests
    /api/block/height/[height] - returns block info in JSON by height
    /api/block/hash/[hash] - returns block info in JSON by hash
    /api/transaction/[hash] - returns transaction info in JSON by hash
    /api/payment_id/[hash] - returns the list of transaction hashes by payment id in JSON
- Changes in node server
    Added nice HTML output to / path with basic stats
    Added plain HTML /supply endpoint that returns a string with total coins in circulation
    Moved /paimentid endpoint to the plain HTML output of randomly generated payment id instead of JSON

Release notes Karbowanec 1.7.2

- Change spent key images storage (reduce memory usage)
- Deterministic transaction keys
- Fixed missing address file name when import tracking wallet
- Fixed validation on atypical to domains
- Flat-rate fee for public nodes
- Poor man's Dandelion protocol
- Proper Base58 encoding of proofs
- Small optimization in pushBlock: do not recalculate block hash
- Tidyup crypto: make crypto primitives more clear, move scattered and repeated definitions to one place, add some new crypto functions, fix compiler warning
- --enable-blockchain-indexes now has a short alias -i

Release notes Karbowanec 1.7.1
 
- Attempt to restore corrupted blockindexes.dat
- Platform independent randomness
- Improvements in simplewallet
- Node update with new endpoints, including info about connections for display in GUI Wallet
- Fix of fee check in Core, fixes syncing from zero with the flag --without-checkpoints
- Ban nodes that stuck too deep behind on fork to spare useless traffic
- Changes in P2P:
    Moved P2P protocol version to common config
    Added warning about outdated software
    Added dropping the connection to outdated too much nodes
    Added anchor connections, based on https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf §4
- Change how we deal with unmixable outputs in wallet:
    if transaction is zero mixin, first take all unmixable outputs to send, then normal outputs
    for transactions with mixin first, take normal outputs, only if not enough take dust, unmixable outputs, obviously, not used for sending
    sweep_dust command is removed from simplewallet
    the warning is displayed when the user has unmixable outputs that he can get rid of them by sending tx with zero mixin
    in the edge case of so many unmixable outputs that it will make tx invalid due to exceeding tx size limit user will have to send them in chunks (at cost of an extra fee, but old behaviour is the same)
    Add tools to get some useful statistics via RPC e.g. for building historical charts

The above changes are partially based on TurtleCoin and Monero solutions.
